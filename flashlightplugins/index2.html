		<h1>Flashlight 1.0 Preview</h1>
		<p>This is a pre-release build of Flashlight 1.0. It's only slightly different from what's currently on GitHub.</p>
		<a class='download' href='/static/preview/Flashlight.zip'>Download</a>
		
		<p>1.0 will go online on Tuesday, 4/10 around 1PM ET at the project's existing URL, flashlight.nateparrott.com. <a href='/preview3'>Here's a preview of the new site.</a></p>
		
		<p>
			Flashlight makes it easier to do common tasks on your Mac, just by typing into a search box. When you just want to send a quick iMessage, look up an emoji, check a fact on the web or add a reminder, launching an entire app is excessive. With Flashlight, you can just open up your Mac's Spotlight search, type a command, hit Enter, and be done with it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since the initial release of the Flashlight alpha last November, tens of thousands of people have downloaded it, hundreds of developers have contributed on Github, and there's over 160 plugins built on its open API.
		</p>
		<p>
			The original Flashlight beta was rough. Flashlight 1.0's goal was polish. The most important plugins — web search, creating reminders, emails and events, and a few more — are polished and bundled by default. It's easy to search for or discover new plugins, and everything is kept up-to-date automatically. The natural language technology underlying Flashlight is more powerful, and it's much faster, too. Flashlight 1.0 is all about polish, speed, and simplicity.
